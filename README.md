Hello Github! Update: Fri Jan 26 09:51:17 PM EST 2024

My Scrum partner was the professor, Shawal Khalid (shawal@vt.edu).
What I did: I completed two assignments relatively early, getting a good jump on the semester.
What I need to do next: I have two projects coming up in other classes that I am really gonna have to focus on.
What is blocking me: Trying to stay fit and keep a good social life while also balancing all this schoolwork
